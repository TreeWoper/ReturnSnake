*This is a game based on the classic snake game,
the main goal is basically the same as the original
but with a need to return to the origin.

*Be aware that the settings menu does NOT work because
I got too lazy at the end and ran out of time

*Controles: basic arrow keys, space bar to selecte from
the menu or use mouse.

*Finaly, I hope that you have fun playing this game, 
I made everything my self not including the music.
